# Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## Background

I got the files to start this challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

## Build Info

I used SCSS preprocessor and used Sass 3.5.1 in order to build index.css: sass index.scss:index.css.

All edits were done using HTML and CSS only.

## Where to find everything

`/design` folder contains both a mobile and a desktop version of the design to work to. 


You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.
